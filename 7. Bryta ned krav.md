# Extend with English name

Several entities are going to be extended with an English name.
For backwards compatibility, we are going to keep the name property.

```json
{
  "name": "string", // swedish text
  "nameText": {
    "sv": "<computed by name>",
    "en": "string"
  }
}
```

## The impacted entities:

- Area: name
- Product: name
- ValidityTimes: name, unit (unit is currently enum)
- Producttype: name
- Pax: name
- ProductChannelLink: productName

## Presentation logic:

- Product: Has a computed column in front-end
- ValidityTimes: Has a computed column in front-end

## Task break down
I want you to create two separate markdown files for compact and distinct implementation steps.
The markdowns should also contain the new API contracts
- ConsumerApiTasks.md
- AdminApiTask.md

## Exclude any UI actions since UI is a separate code repository
