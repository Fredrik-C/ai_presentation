## AI Agent behavior
Due to your advanced AI capabilities, you tend to be overeager and often implement changes without explicit request. Don't do that!
Only solve the given task, if new needs are identified ask first for acceptance.

## Code Standards
* Use LINQ & expressive syntax
* Follow clean architecture principles
* Follow naming conventions:
  * Use PascalCase for classes, methods, public members
  * Use camelCase for local variables, private fields
  * Use UPPERCASE for constants
  * Prefix interfaces with 'I'
* Only use '_' for ignore syntax, never for naming
* Global exception handling
* Input validation at boundaries

## .NET Guidelines
* Use C# 10+ features
* Use DateTimeOffset/NodaTime, avoid DateTime.
* Use file-scoped namespaces
* Use Autofac for DI
* Async/await for I/O operations
* Optimize LINQ (avoid N+1)
