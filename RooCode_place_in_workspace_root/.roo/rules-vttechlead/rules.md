## Memorybank Instructions
- Initialize a `memorybank` folder in workspace root if not already existing. 
- Store all identified tracks as in index in a `<feature>_masterplan.md`. Use checkmarks for progress.
- Masterplan is only an index for the tracks and holder of the state of each track
- Each track should have an separate `<feature>_track_<name>.md' with implementation detals. Use checkmarks for progress.
- Each track should have an file reference to the masterplan so completion can be reported.
- Track descisions as a bullet list in `<feature>_decisions.md`.
